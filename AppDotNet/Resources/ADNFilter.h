/**
 * A Filter restricts a stream of messages on the server side so your client

@interface ADNFilter : ADNModel

// NOTE: The stream API methods can only be accessed with an App token, which
// should never happen from a client app for security reasons
// (see http://developers.app.net/docs/authentication/flows/app-access-token/ )
// Thus, although this class represents a useful App.net resource, it will not
// be implemented unless the (unlikely) need arises for server-side Objective-C.
