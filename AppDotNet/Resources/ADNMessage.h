/**
 * A Message is very similar to a Post but 1) it doesnâ€™t have to be public and
 * 2) it will be delivered to an arbitrary set of users (not just the users who
 * follow the Message creator). For an overview of the App.net messaging API,
 * please see the [Introduction to App.net Messaging](http://developers.app.net/docs/basics/messaging).
